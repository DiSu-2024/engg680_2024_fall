Lab Assignment 1 - Student Gradebook Management System

This project involves developing a Python-based system to track student grades efficiently, replacing outdated manual methods.

This assignment is a group assignment consisting of four members, to collaborate using Github and Google Colabs. The aim is to learn basic functions such as importing and collaborating in Github repositories, bookkeeping and python coding. The assignment also simulates a company, Deep-AutoLab, where group members are to employ Python-based codes and functions to modernize and automate the tracking of student GPAs to streamline the management of student grades for enhanced accuracy and ease of use.
